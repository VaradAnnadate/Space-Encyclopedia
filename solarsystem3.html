        <p class="uranusText"><span>Uranus</span>: It is the seventh planet from the Sun and a blue-green "ice giant," composed mostly of water, ammonia, and methane. Its most striking feature is a dramatic axial tilt that causes it to appear to roll on its side, a likely result of a past collision with another celestial body.</p>

        <p class="neptuneText"><span>Neptune</span>: It is the eighth and outermost planet in our solar system, known for its deep blue color, intense winds, and frigid temperatures. As the densest of the gas giants, it's sometimes called an "ice giant" due to its composition of hydrogen, helium, and methane ice.</p>

    <p class = plutoText>
        <span>Pluto</span>: Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt, a ring of icy bodies beyond Neptune's orbit. It was once considered the ninth planet but was reclassified in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) because it had not "cleared its orbit" of other debris. Pluto is a small, icy world made of rock and nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide ices, with a thin atmosphere.
